"Project Rosalind" Playground
=============================

[Project Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) is a collection of coding problems, similar to Project Euler, but around the theme of bioinformatics. They are really fun, and happen to be great F# coding exercises.

This "Project Rosalind" playground is a place where the San Francisco F# group members can share the result of their efforts. Add a folder named {your-Twitter-handle} and show us what you've done!
